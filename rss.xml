            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My New Year’s Reflections </h1><p> A new year, another opportunity to reflect and look forward.

My romantic partner of one-and-a-half years (who is now also my business partner) is someone who reflects and sets goals. She is also someone who gets stuff done. When she sent me a list of twelve reflection questions – six for the past year, six for the year to come – I decided to give them their due attention. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8383005498dc2130d121481be44b7cb4b72b67c0.jpg"></article>]]></description>
